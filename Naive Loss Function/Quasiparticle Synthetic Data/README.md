The implementation for this was much simpler. I slightly modified code in the MKIDReadoutAnalysis Package in order to interface the quasiparticle density synthetic data generation method with my machine learning code. I trained my model on the poisson distributed data, then used my existing evaluation framework to characterize it's performance.

The MKIDReadoutAnalsis Folder contains the modified code for the synthetic data generation package.
