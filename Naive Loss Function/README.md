This folder contains three subfolders: one with the most naive implementation (the "First Implementation") of the machine learning model and synthetic data generation, one with a naive implementation of the machine learning model using Tensorflow's Functional API and a more sophisticated version of the stitched synthetic data generation, and finally, a directory with the same machine learning model as the previous directory but using the (modified) quasiparticle density synthetic data generation python package. 

In each folder, I go into more depth about how each implementation functions.
