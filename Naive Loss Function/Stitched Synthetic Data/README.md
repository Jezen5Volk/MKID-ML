Using Tensorflow's Functional API and my more sophisticated version of stitching together the synthetic data (elaborated upon in the README.md file in the Statistical Loss Function directory) I trained a model on the synthetic data, then characterized and evaluated it. 

To evaluate it, I generated a number of photon events for a given wavelength, group all of the model's energy predictions in a histogram, then convert from phase to energy [eV]. Thus, the predictions can be compared against the actual energy of a photon at the given wavelength. Then the histograms of the model's predictions for a given wavelength are compared against the histogram generated by the optimal filter for that wavelength. This way, the model's performance and energy resolution can be compared to that of the optimal filter.
