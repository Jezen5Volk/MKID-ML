# MKID-ML
Using Tensorflow I trained, evaluated, and characterized a machine learning model to bypass computationally expensive optimal filtering in the MKID data analysis pipeline. This involved generating a synthetic data set, bootstrap resampling to determine appropriate resizing factors, and interfacing with Tensorflow's Subclassing and Functional API.
